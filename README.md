### Simple Email generation
If you only want to generate different email addresses, you can just directly use Email.py.</br>
To run & generate a new email address:

`python Email.py`

There are two options to generate a mail address:</br>
OR using scrambled characters, </br>
OR using more 'human' names for generating the username.

By default, more human names are chosen constructing the username as part of the mail address.
You can play with 'adjectives' & 'nouns' list in the code to generate even more different email addresses.

If you'd need scrambled characters for the user name, the 'scrambled' variable can be used:

`python Email.py --scrambled=True`
